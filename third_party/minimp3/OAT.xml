                        Statement of Purpose

                        The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
                        exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
                        subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &quot;owner&quot;) of an original work of
                        authorship and/or a database (each, a &quot;Work&quot; ).

                        Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
                        purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
                        works (&quot;Commons&quot;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later
                        claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
                        and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
                        purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
                        contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
                        further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
                        reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
                        efforts of others.

                        For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
                        of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
                        Work (the &quot;Affirmer&quot;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
                        and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
                        and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
                        Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
                        effect of CC0 on those rights.

                        1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
                        protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&quot;Copyright and
                        Related Rights&quot;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
                        to, the following:

                        i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
                        and translate a Work;

                        ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

                        iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
                        depicted in a Work;

                        iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
                        subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

                        v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
                        a Work;

                        vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
                        European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
                        protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
                        including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

                        vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
                        based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

                        2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
                        applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
                        unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
                        and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
                        known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
                        action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
                        duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
                        extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
                        copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
                        commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &quot;Waiver&quot;). Affirmer makes
                        the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
                        detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
                        shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
                        any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
                        by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

                        3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
                        judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
                        shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
                        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
                        is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
                        non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
                        unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
                        the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
                        provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
                        in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
                        purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
                        promotional purposes (the &quot;License&quot;). The License shall be deemed effective as
                        of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
                        License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
                        applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
                        invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
                        affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
                        Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
                        and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
                        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

                        4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

                        a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
                        surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

                        b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
                        of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
                        including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
                        for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
                        other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
                        discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

                        c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
                        that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
                        any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
                        disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
                        or other rights required for any use of the Work.

                        d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
                        party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
                        CC0 or use of the Work.
