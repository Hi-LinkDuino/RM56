    "description": "lwIP is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite that has been initially developed by Adam Dunkels. The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce resource usage while still having a full scale TCP. This makes lwIP suitable for use in embedded systems with tens of kilobytes of free RAM and room for around 40 kilobytes of code ROM.",
